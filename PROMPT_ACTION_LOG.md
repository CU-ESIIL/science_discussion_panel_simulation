# Prompt Action Log

This log records implementation prompts that change the reusable ScienceClaw/OASIS template. Keep private user data, credentials, and live workspace secrets out of this file.

## 2026-07-10 - Container Purpose And Local Use Documentation

### Prompt Summary

Update `AGENTS.md`, the prompt log, and the website so the repository clearly
explains what the OASIS Scientific Discussion Panel container does and what
people need to run it locally.

### Files Changed

- `AGENTS.md`
- `.gitignore`
- `docs/index.md`
- `docs/quick-start.md`
- `docs/use/launch-locally.md`
- `docs/setup.md`
- `docs/resource-limits.md`
- `docs/start-here/index.md`
- `CHANGELOG.md`
- `PROMPT_ACTION_LOG.md`

### Architectural Decisions

- Present this repository as a reusable ScienceClaw/OpenClaw container appliance
  rather than only a static documentation website.
- Make the three local services explicit: OpenClaw Gateway, Workspace CMS, and
  JupyterLab.
- Document the runtime split between repository source, replaceable container,
  active `./workspace` memory, `./data` outputs, `./external_storage`, `.env`,
  and ignored `./secrets`.
- Clarify that a no-secrets local run supports the UI, seeded panel workspace,
  deterministic demo, and panel controls, while live model calls and GitHub
  write operations require local credentials.
- Clarify that GitHub organization secrets are available to GitHub Actions
  runners, not automatically to laptop Docker Compose runs.
- Document `SCIENCECLAW_CONTAINER_MEMORY=20g` as the 20 GiB container memory
  setting while noting that host Docker must allow the memory and that bind
  mounts are not capped by Compose disk quotas.
- Ignore generated `workspace/projects/*` runtime scaffolds while preserving the
  tracked example project.

### Tests Run

- Local Compose stack was rebuilt and run with Docker Desktop.
- Verified `openclaw-local`, `workspace-cms`, and `workspace-ui` were running.
- Verified the OpenClaw Gateway, Workspace CMS, and JupyterLab URLs returned
  pages from the host.
- Verified the `openclaw-local` container memory limit was `21474836480` bytes
  with a 2 CPU cap.
- Verified `scienceclaw-panel-control status --workspace /data/workspace`
  reported the seeded panel state.

## 2026-05-25 - Project Workspace And External Data Routing

### Prompt Summary

Use the gateway 1 to gateway 3 handoff as an opportunity to establish a durable project-folder structure that lets gateway 3 link to remote drives, external storage, and GitHub repositories without loading everything into the container.

### Files Changed

- `projects/fractal_corridors/STORAGE.yml`
- `projects/fractal_corridors/WORKSPACE_NOTES.md`
- `CHANGELOG.md`
- `PROMPT_ACTION_LOG.md`

### Architectural Decisions

- Treat `/workspace/projects/<slug>` as a small control plane for each science project, not a bulk data directory.
- Keep imported snapshots under `/workspace/imports/` and route active work through project manifests.
- Keep large local or remote-mounted data under `/external_storage/local/<project-slug>`.
- Use `PROJECT.yaml`, `DATA_MANIFEST.md`, `GITHUB_REPOS.md`, `EXTERNAL_LINKS.md`, `STORAGE.yml`, and `WORKSPACE_NOTES.md` as the standard project control files.
- Instantiate gateway 3's first project folder as `fractal-corridors`, linked to `/workspace/imports/gateway1-2026-05-25`.
- Add matching project-routing manifests to the tracked `projects/fractal_corridors` snapshot so the GitHub repository preserves the handoff structure.
- Add `RESOURCE_MAP.md` as the always-on agent orientation file for filesystem, GitHub, external storage, skill, and job decisions.
- Mirror gateway-3-only handoff/resource notes into `projects/fractal_corridors` because live `instances/` runtime folders are intentionally ignored by git.

### Tests Run

- `bash -n docker/seed-workspace/scripts/init-working-group.sh`
- Temporary workspace seed test confirmed `projects/README.md`, `projects/_template/PROJECT.yaml`, and `projects/_template/STORAGE.yml` are created.
- Temporary workspace seed test confirmed `RESOURCE_MAP.md` is created.
- `git diff --check`
- Verified gateway 3 agents can see `/workspace/projects/fractal-corridors` and `/external_storage/local/fractal-corridors`.
- Verified gateway 3 agents can see `/workspace/RESOURCE_MAP.md`.
- Verified gateway 3 file manager lists `/workspace/projects/fractal-corridors`.
- Scanned the gateway 3 fractal-corridors project folder and external shelf for obvious token patterns.

## 2026-05-25 - CMS Back To OpenClaw Navigation

### Prompt Summary

Add clear navigation from the full-page file manager and GitHub manager back to the matching OpenClaw main page so users do not have to rely on browser history.

### Files Changed

- `cms/scienceclaw_cms.py`
- `docker-compose.yml`
- `docs/workspace-cms.md`
- `docs/workspace-file-manager.md`
- `scripts/smoke_test_github_manager.sh`
- `scripts/smoke_test_workspace.sh`
- `CHANGELOG.md`
- `PROMPT_ACTION_LOG.md`

### Architectural Decisions

- Put the navigation in the shared CMS page shell so Files, GitHub, CMS Home, browse, preview, edit, and result pages all receive the same header.
- Pass `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_PORT` into the CMS service and allow `SCIENCECLAW_GATEWAY_URL` as an explicit override for non-local deployments.

### Tests Run

- `python3 -m py_compile cms/scienceclaw_cms.py`
- `bash -n scripts/smoke_test_workspace.sh scripts/smoke_test_github_manager.sh`
- `docker compose config --quiet`
- `scripts/smoke_test_workspace.sh` with local port access enabled after sandbox port binding was blocked.
- `scripts/smoke_test_github_manager.sh` with local port access enabled after sandbox port binding was blocked.
- Recreated gateway 3's CMS service with `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_PORT=18791`, copied in the updated CMS script, and restarted `scienceclaw-project-three-workspace-cms-1`.
- Verified live gateway 3 Files and GitHub pages include `Back to OpenClaw` pointing to `http://127.0.0.1:18791/`.
- Verified live gateway 3 CMS `/api/file/list` and `/api/github/status` still return JSON.

## 2026-05-25 - GitHub Auth Directions And OpenClaw Update Guardrails

### Prompt Summary

Document how users authenticate GitHub access for gateway 3 and spawned ScienceClaw instances, then verify that OpenClaw updates can be tested without losing the branded Control UI, embedded Files sidebar, embedded GitHub Auth sidebar, or CMS API access.

### Files Changed

- `docs/github-repository-manager.md`
- `docs/instance-runbook.md`
- `docs/quick-start.md`
- `docs/security-and-credentials.md`
- `CHANGELOG.md`
- `PROMPT_ACTION_LOG.md`

### Architectural Decisions

- Keep GitHub credentials outside `.env` by default and use a mounted `secrets/github_token` file for repeatable local and spawned-instance launches.
- Make **GitHub Auth** in the sidebar the preferred human path for configuring git credentials after token injection.
- Treat OpenClaw updates as per-instance experiments that require reapplying the ScienceClaw Control UI patch and verifying the CMS content security policy before returning the instance to project work.

### Tests Run

- `docker exec scienceclaw-project-three-openclaw-local-run-96075a70e8ae openclaw update --dry-run --json`
- `docker exec scienceclaw-project-three-openclaw-local-run-96075a70e8ae openclaw update --yes --no-restart --timeout 600`
- Reapplied ScienceClaw Control UI branding assets to gateway 3 and restarted `scienceclaw-project-three-openclaw-local-run-96075a70e8ae`.
- Verified gateway 3 upgraded from OpenClaw `2026.5.18` to `2026.5.22`.
- Verified the served Control UI content security policy still includes `http://127.0.0.1:8092` and `http://localhost:8092`.
- Verified `scienceclaw-file-list` and `scienceclaw-repo-form` remain present in the patched Control UI script.
- Verified CMS `/api/file/list`, `/api/github/repos`, and `/api/github/status` return JSON after the update.
- Verified `openclaw status` reports OpenClaw `2026.5.22`, 11 agents, and no pending package update.
- Verified direct Verde smoke test with session `scienceclaw-update-smoke-20260525` returned exactly `UPDATE_OK`.

### Known Limitations

- The token file path must exist on the launch host or runner before the secrets overlay can mount it.
- Full MkDocs rendering was not validated in this environment because neither host Python nor the CMS container has `mkdocs` installed.
- The in-app browser connector did not expose an active browser pane for a visual screenshot check, so the live UI was validated through HTTP headers, patched asset checks, CMS API responses, and a direct agent smoke test.

## 2026-05-24 - Sidebar Workspace Tools And GitHub Secrets Runtime Path

### Prompt Summary

Assess the repo/container state, then make the basics more robust: browser-visible file access, GitHub authentication without hand-maintained local `.env` credentials, and button-based repository actions instead of fragile slash approval commands.

### Files Changed

- `.github/workflows/scienceclaw-runtime.yml`
- `branding/control-ui/scienceclaw-brand.css`
- `branding/control-ui/scienceclaw-brand.js`
- `cms/scienceclaw_cms.py`
- `docker-compose.yml`
- `docs/github-repository-manager.md`
- `docs/instance-runbook.md`
- `docs/oasis-template.md`
- `docs/quick-start.md`
- `docs/security-and-credentials.md`
- `docs/workspace-file-manager.md`
- `scripts/install-control-ui-branding.sh`
- `scripts/smoke_test_github_manager.sh`
- `scripts/start-instance.sh`

### Architectural Decisions

- Keep Files and GitHub Auth as CMS-backed workspace tools, but expose compact live summaries directly inside the OpenClaw sidebar so the user does not have to leave chat.
- Treat the CMS GitHub manager as the preferred human-button path for clone, branch, commit, push, and PR actions.
- Add a CMS **Configure git credentials** button that reruns GitHub CLI credential setup without printing tokens.
- Make spawned instances apply the Docker secrets overlay when a GitHub token file is available.
- Add a manual GitHub Actions workflow for self-hosted runner launches that materializes GitHub Secrets only on the runner and smoke-tests the runtime.

### Tests Run

- `bash -n scripts/start-instance.sh scripts/install-control-ui-branding.sh scripts/smoke_test_github_manager.sh docker/entrypoint.sh docker/service-entrypoint.sh`
- `python3 -m py_compile cms/scienceclaw_cms.py`
- `docker compose config --quiet`
- `SCIENCECLAW_GITHUB_TOKEN_FILE=/tmp/nonexistent docker compose --project-name scienceclaw-check -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.secrets.yml config --quiet`
- `git diff --check`
- `node --check branding/control-ui/scienceclaw-brand.js`
- `scripts/smoke_test_github_manager.sh` with local port access enabled after the sandbox blocked temporary server binding.
- Reapplied updated CMS and Control UI branding assets into live gateway 3, verified the CMS GitHub status endpoint, and verified the sidebar opens the GitHub Auth embedded panel.

### Known Limitations

- The sidebar panels show compact file and GitHub summaries. The direct CMS URLs remain available for full-page workflows.
- GitHub-hosted Actions runners are ephemeral; durable gateways should use a self-hosted runner, Codespaces-like host, Kubernetes, or another long-running host.

## 2026-05-22 - Gateway 3 Reproducible Container Rebuild

### Prompt Summary

Reassess gateway 3 after the update banner was hidden but browser chat still failed. The user asked for a robust container shape: branded OpenClaw, file-structure visibility for produced content, and GitHub repository read/write capability.

### Files Changed

- `Dockerfile`
- `docker-compose.yml`
- `docker/service-entrypoint.sh`
- `docs/instance-runbook.md`
- `docs/operations.md`

### Architectural Decisions

- Pin the reusable image to OpenClaw `2026.5.18`, the current known-good local browser-chat baseline.
- Keep only the Gateway service responsible for OpenClaw startup, OpenClaw state, Slack registration, branding injection, agent registry, and sessions.
- Start JupyterLab without the OpenClaw Gateway entrypoint so it cannot mutate Gateway config or sessions.
- Start the CMS through a small service entrypoint that only loads GitHub secret files, mirrors `GITHUB_TOKEN`/`GH_TOKEN`, configures GitHub CLI credential helpers, and marks workspace repositories as safe directories.
- Preserve the file manager and GitHub repository manager as CMS features over the shared `/workspace`, not as OpenClaw session writers.

### Tests Run

- `bash -n docker/entrypoint.sh docker/service-entrypoint.sh scripts/start-instance.sh scripts/install-control-ui-branding.sh`
- `docker compose config --quiet`
- `docker compose build openclaw-local`
- Restarted gateway 3 with `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR=/private/tmp/scienceclaw-project-three-openclaw ./scripts/start-instance.sh project-three 18791 8890 8092`.
- Verified rebuilt gateway 3 reports `OpenClaw 2026.5.18`.
- Verified gateway 3 has 11 agents with `openclaw agents list`.
- Verified direct agent smoke test returned `PINNED_OK`.
- Verified CMS file API returns the `/workspace` listing.
- Verified CMS GitHub status endpoint is reachable and reports unauthenticated when no GitHub token is present.
- Archived the poisoned `agent:main:gateway3-fixed` session and moved the browser to a fresh dashboard session.

### Known Limitations

- GitHub repository operations still require a `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GH_TOKEN`, or interactive `gh auth login` inside the CMS service.
- The update notice can still appear in CLI status because a newer upstream OpenClaw package exists; local ScienceClaw upgrades remain a pinned-image rebuild workflow.
- Browser text-entry automation was blocked by the in-app browser clipboard layer, so the browser path was validated by connection/session state plus direct OpenClaw smoke tests rather than an automated typed UI prompt.
- Follow-up details and next steps are captured in `docs/gateway-3-handoff.md`.

## 2026-05-22 - Gateway 3 Fresh Diagnosis and Verde Tool Profile Repair

### Prompt Summary

Reinspect gateways 1, 2, and 3 after gateway 3 continued failing to reply. Gateway 1 and 2 were running the older image and OpenClaw `2026.5.18`; gateway 3 was on the newer local image, also OpenClaw `2026.5.18`, but direct agent smoke tests failed with `session file changed while embedded prompt lock was released`.

### Files Changed

- `.env.example`
- `README.md`
- `docker/entrypoint.sh`
- `docs/instance-runbook.md`
- `docs/security-and-credentials.md`
- `scripts/start-instance.sh`

### Architectural Decisions

- Keep the AI-VERDE/OpenAI-compatible route on a minimal OpenClaw tool profile for the default ScienceClaw gateway path.
- Preserve automatic visible replies instead of the experimental `message_tool` reply mode for the local working-group template.
- Set `models.mode` to `merge` during bootstrap so provider additions do not replace working defaults.
- Keep gateway 3 heartbeat disabled for now; the direct smoke failure was reproduced without relying on heartbeat activity, so heartbeat is not the only root cause.
- Keep per-instance OpenClaw runtime state on local non-synced storage (`/private/tmp/scienceclaw-<instance>-openclaw`) while leaving the project workspace under `instances/<name>/workspace`.
- Treat GitHub Secrets as the scalable credential source, materialized into runner-local secret files and passed through provider `_FILE` variables.

### Tests Run

- Compared gateway 1, 2, and 3 with `docker ps`, `openclaw --version`, `openclaw status`, and `openclaw agents list`.
- Confirmed gateway 2 passed: `openclaw agent --agent main --session-id gateway2-fresh-codex-smoke-20260522a --model verde/js2/gpt-oss-120b --message "Reply with exactly: OK" --timeout 120 --json`.
- Confirmed gateway 3 failed before repair on fresh explicit sessions, while the session JSONL still contained the assistant reply.
- Patched gateway 3 runtime config to match gateway 2's `models.mode`, visible reply mode, and minimal Verde tool profile.
- Confirmed gateway 3 passed after repair: `openclaw agent --agent main --session-id gateway3-fresh-codex-smoke-20260522c --model verde/js2/gpt-oss-120b --message "Reply with exactly: OK" --timeout 120 --json`.
- Restarted gateway 3 with OpenClaw state mounted from `/private/tmp/scienceclaw-project-three-openclaw`.
- Confirmed gateway 3 browser chat replied with `G3_UI_OK`.

### Known Limitations

- Gateway 3's currently running container was repaired through its mounted runtime config. Rebuild/recreate from the updated image is still needed to prove the reusable entrypoint fix from a clean start.
- Heartbeats remain disabled on gateway 3 until a safe heartbeat session strategy is designed and tested.
- GitHub Secrets are documented as the intended scalable source, but a production deployment workflow still needs a target runtime choice such as self-hosted runner, Codespaces, Kubernetes, or another host.

## 2026-05-22 - Multi-Instance Gateway Recovery Runbook

### Prompt Summary

Document the repeated gateway setup problem observed while spawning additional ScienceClaw instances: missing agent dropdowns, one-agent OpenClaw state, stale or locked `agent:main:main` sessions, confusing update banners, and uncertainty about whether GitHub or the Gateway caused the failure.

### Files Changed

- `docs/instance-runbook.md`
- `docs/use/launch-locally.md`
- `docs/troubleshooting.md`
- `docs/operations.md`
- `scripts/start-instance.sh`
- `mkdocs.yml`

### Architectural Decisions

- Treat each spawned ScienceClaw instance as a separate appliance with its own Gateway, OpenClaw state, workspace, data root, external storage, JupyterLab port, and CMS port.
- Validate a new instance before project work by checking OpenClaw version, status, agent registry, sessions, and a dedicated smoke-test session.
- Use unique smoke-test session ids. Do not run CLI smoke tests against the browser's active `agent:main:main` transcript.
- If a session-lock error appears, archive the failed transcript instead of deleting the whole OpenClaw state directory.
- If an instance only has `main`, restore the agent registry without copying another instance's token, port, allowed origins, sessions, or project workspace.
- After a live `openclaw update`, reapply the ScienceClaw Control UI branding layer because upstream package updates replace the patched Control UI asset directory.

### Tests Run

- Documentation and script edits only in this action.
- Earlier operational diagnosis used `openclaw status`, `openclaw agents list`, `openclaw sessions --agent main --json`, `openclaw tasks list --json`, `docker logs`, and direct `openclaw agent` smoke tests.

### Known Limitations

- The root OpenClaw session-lock behavior is upstream/runtime behavior, not fully controlled by this repository.
- The runbook documents recovery and prevention. It does not add a fully automated repair command.
- OpenClaw update banners should be interpreted cautiously; version changes must be validated per instance, and ScienceClaw branding may need to be reapplied after live updates.

### Unresolved Issues

- Decide whether `scripts/start-instance.sh` should eventually run the validation checks automatically and fail fast if the 11-agent registry is missing.
- Consider adding a dedicated `scripts/validate-instance.sh` helper once the OpenClaw CLI behavior stabilizes.

## 2026-05-20 - Next Phase Stabilization

### Prompt Summary

Stabilize the feature-rich OpenClaw container prototype into a documented, reusable OASIS ScienceClaw working-group appliance. Emphasis: onboarding clarity, architecture communication, one end-to-end workflow, smoke tests, operational commands, reproducibility, and human trust.

### Files Changed

- `README.md`
- `Makefile`
- `scripts/demo_environmental_workflow.py`
- `scripts/smoke_test.sh`
- `docs/quick-start.md`
- `docs/architecture.md`
- `docs/storage-model.md`
- `docs/agent-team.md`
- `docs/cms-output-review.md`
- `docs/slack-integration.md`
- `docs/kubernetes-workers.md`
- `docs/security-and-credentials.md`
- `docs/troubleshooting.md`
- `mkdocs.yml`
- `CHANGELOG.md`

### Architectural Decisions

- Keep the README as a concise front door and move long-form explanation into MkDocs pages.
- Establish `make demo` and `make smoke-test` as the stable operational proof path.
- Use a deterministic synthetic environmental workflow rather than network data or API keys.
- Keep Kubernetes and Slack documented as optional or experimental surfaces.
- Preserve the PI Liaison, human-review, CMS/output review, and three-zone storage models.

### Tests Run

- `bash -n` on new shell scripts.
- `make help`.
- `make demo`.
- `make smoke-test`.
- `scripts/test-scienceclaw-layout.sh`.
- `make doctor`.
- `make checkpoint`.
- Local markdown link checks.

### Known Limitations

- Host Python may not include the full geospatial stack; `make smoke-test` reports that as a warning outside the container while still validating the deterministic demo workflow.
- MkDocs build requires MkDocs dependencies to be installed in the current environment or run inside an environment with `requirements.txt`.
- The demo workflow is operational proof only and should not be interpreted as a scientific model.

### Unresolved Issues

- CI should eventually run `make smoke-test` inside the built container image to validate the full geospatial stack.
- Additional screenshots and polished diagrams can be added after the documentation structure settles.

## 2026-05-20 - Workspace File Manager

### Prompt Summary

Add a clean, integrated workspace file manager so ScienceClaw users can browse the container, inspect `/workspace`, preview outputs, edit safe text files, and understand what agents created without switching to a separate notebook interface.

### Files Changed

- `cms/scienceclaw_cms.py`
- `Dockerfile`
- `docker/entrypoint.sh`
- `branding/control-ui/scienceclaw-brand.js`
- `branding/control-ui/scienceclaw-brand.css`
- `scripts/install-control-ui-branding.sh`
- `scripts/seed_file_manager_demo.py`
- `scripts/smoke_test_workspace.sh`
- `scripts/smoke_test.sh`
- `Makefile`
- `README.md`
- `docs/quick-start.md`
- `docs/architecture.md`
- `docs/workspace-file-manager.md`
- `docs/workspace-cms.md`
- `mkdocs.yml`

### Architectural Decisions

- Extend the existing lightweight CMS service instead of introducing a second file-management framework.
- Use `/` as the visual browsing root while failing closed around sensitive files and directories.
- Restrict browser write operations to safe roots such as `/workspace`, `/data/outputs`, and `/tmp`.
- Add an OpenClaw sidebar Files link that opens the file manager for the matching ScienceClaw instance.
- Seed a tiny demo workspace at startup unless `SCIENCECLAW_SEED_FILE_MANAGER_DEMO=0` is set.
- Keep JupyterLab as the advanced analytics interface; the file manager is for inspection, output review, and small edits.

### Tests Run

- `python3 -m py_compile cms/scienceclaw_cms.py scripts/seed_file_manager_demo.py scripts/demo_environmental_workflow.py`
- `bash -n scripts/smoke_test_workspace.sh`
- `bash -n scripts/smoke_test.sh`
- `scripts/smoke_test_workspace.sh`
- `make smoke-test`
- `git diff --check`

### Known Limitations

- The Files link opens the CMS file manager route on the CMS port rather than reverse-proxying the route through the OpenClaw gateway.
- The Markdown renderer is intentionally lightweight and designed for inspection, not full static-site rendering parity.
- Browser-side drag-and-drop upload is not yet implemented; standard file upload is supported.

### Recommended Next Steps

- Add a reverse proxy route if OpenClaw exposes a stable extension point for embedding `/files` under the gateway origin.
- Add optional richer previews for Parquet, GeoJSON, rasters, and notebooks after the core file workflow is stable.

## 2026-05-20 - GitHub Repository Manager

### Prompt Summary

Add a dedicated GitHub manager so ScienceClaw/OpenClaw users can authorize selected external project repositories, clone them into the workspace, inspect branch status, and follow a branch-and-pull-request contribution workflow without granting agents broad account-wide GitHub access.

### Files Changed

- `.env.example`
- `Makefile`
- `README.md`
- `branding/control-ui/scienceclaw-brand.css`
- `branding/control-ui/scienceclaw-brand.js`
- `cms/scienceclaw_cms.py`
- `docs/architecture.md`
- `docs/github-repository-manager.md`
- `docs/quick-start.md`
- `docs/workspace-cms.md`
- `mkdocs.yml`
- `scripts/smoke_test.sh`
- `scripts/smoke_test_github_manager.sh`

### Auth Model Chosen

The first implementation supports GitHub CLI authentication with `gh auth login` and `gh auth setup-git`, plus optional fine-grained `GITHUB_TOKEN` injection through local secrets. GitHub App authentication is documented as the preferred long-term approach but is not required for this first version.

### Implementation Strategy

- Store authorized repositories in `/workspace/.openclaw-github/authorized-repos.yaml`.
- Clone repositories only under `/workspace/repos/`.
- Implement `read`, `contribute`, and visible-but-disabled `admin` permission tiers.
- Use argument-array `git` and `gh` invocations for narrow operations.
- Block direct writes and pushes on `main` and `master`.
- Add a branded GitHub link beside Files in the OpenClaw sidebar.

### Tests Run

- `python3 -m py_compile cms/scienceclaw_cms.py scripts/seed_file_manager_demo.py scripts/demo_environmental_workflow.py`
- `bash -n scripts/smoke_test_github_manager.sh scripts/smoke_test_workspace.sh scripts/smoke_test.sh docker/entrypoint.sh`
- `scripts/smoke_test_github_manager.sh`
- `make smoke-test`
- `git diff --check`

### Known Limitations

- The GitHub manager opens on the CMS port rather than being reverse-proxied under the OpenClaw gateway origin.
- Authenticated remote operations require valid GitHub credentials and are not exercised by unauthenticated smoke tests.
- GitHub App authentication, automatic issue management, review UI, and merge automation are not implemented.

### Recommended Next Steps

- Add optional GitHub App installation support for selected repositories.
- Add richer PR status display once authenticated integration tests are available.
- Add an optional prompt/action-log append helper for connected repositories that already use `PROMPT_ACTION_LOG.md`.

## 2026-05-21 - Secret-Backed GitHub Agent Access

### Prompt Summary

Make the desired deployment experience explicit: a user can pull or build the ScienceClaw container, provide credentials through local secrets, and start a working group whose agents and GitHub manager can operate on selected organization repositories.

### Files Changed

- `.env.example`
- `README.md`
- `docker-compose.secrets.yml`
- `docker/entrypoint.sh`
- `docs/github-repository-manager.md`
- `docs/quick-start.md`
- `docs/security-and-credentials.md`

### Architectural Decisions

- Support `_FILE` secret variables for Slack, OpenAI, AI-VERDE, GitHub, and Tavily credentials.
- Mirror `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `GH_TOKEN` at startup so GitHub CLI and standard tooling can use the same secret.
- Configure GitHub CLI/git credential helpers during container startup when a GitHub token is present.
- Keep repository access bounded by the GitHub manager allowlist and `/workspace/repos/` clone root.

### Tests Run

- `bash -n docker/entrypoint.sh`
- `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.secrets.yml config`

### Known Limitations

- The current local containers must be rebuilt or recreated to pick up entrypoint changes.
- Fine-grained GitHub tokens still need the correct repository scopes from GitHub; ScienceClaw cannot grant missing organization permissions.
- GitHub App installation remains the preferred long-term organization-scale auth model.

## 2026-05-21 - Gateway 3 Session-Lock Recovery

### Prompt Summary

Recover the third local ScienceClaw gateway after repeated OpenClaw browser-chat failures with `session file changed while embedded prompt lock was released`.

### Files Changed

- `docs/instance-runbook.md`

### Architectural Decisions

- Treat OpenClaw `2026.5.18` as the current known-good local baseline because gateway 2 remained stable on that version.
- Treat OpenClaw `2026.5.20` as unvalidated for the branded multi-instance template after gateway 3 repeatedly failed browser sessions on that version.
- Preserve runtime work by archiving failed session transcripts instead of deleting the full OpenClaw state directory.
- Disable the default PI Liaison heartbeat for gateway 3 by setting the `main` agent heartbeat interval to an empty string; the 30-minute default heartbeat was repeatedly touching `agent:main:main` and recreating the lock failure.

### Tests Run

- `docker exec scienceclaw-project-three-openclaw-local-run-add2042ee2e3 openclaw --version`
- `docker exec scienceclaw-project-three-openclaw-local-run-add2042ee2e3 openclaw status`
- `docker exec scienceclaw-project-three-openclaw-local-run-add2042ee2e3 openclaw agent --agent main --session-id gateway3-518-smoke-... --model verde/js2/gpt-oss-120b --message "Reply with exactly: OK" --timeout 120 --json`
- `docker exec scienceclaw-project-three-openclaw-local-run-add2042ee2e3 openclaw agent --agent main --session-id gateway3-final-smoke-... --model verde/js2/gpt-oss-120b --message "Reply with exactly: OK" --timeout 120 --json`

### Known Limitations

- The browser UI still needs a fresh session after recovery; old tabs can hold stale session state.
- The update banner will still appear because `2026.5.20` exists upstream, but updating the active gateway should wait until a browser-session smoke test validates the newer release.

## 2026-05-22 - Gateway 3 Slash Command Triage

### Prompt Summary

Diagnose whether broken browser slash commands require a gateway 3 container reset.

### Files Changed

- `docs/gateway-3-handoff.md`
- `PROMPT_ACTION_LOG.md`

### Findings

- A full reset is not the right next step.
- `openclaw health` reports the Gateway event loop as OK.
- Gateway logs show successful `commands.list` responses from the Control UI, so the slash-command catalog is loading.
- `openclaw approvals get` is the supported approval inspection command in OpenClaw `2026.5.18`; `openclaw approvals list --json` is not supported.
- The approval snapshot shows no visible pending approval queue, so the browser message asking for bare `/approve` is likely stale or malformed UX.
- Browser chat failures are still primarily `verde/js2/gpt-oss-120b` returning reasoning-only/incomplete terminal responses.

### Recommended Next Steps

- Restart the gateway only if the browser reconnect/device state appears wedged; do not wipe `/workspace` or OpenClaw state.
- Move PI Liaison browser chat to a higher-reliability model route, likely Codex/OAuth after re-authentication inside the live gateway container.
- Use the CMS GitHub manager for clone/read/write/PR workflows instead of depending on chat-generated shell approval prompts.

## 2026-05-22 - Gateway 3 Verde Profile Reconciliation

### Prompt Summary

Compare gateway 3 against working gateways 1 and 2, then make gateway 3 use the stable Verde-only profile.

### Files Changed

- `.env.example`
- `docker/entrypoint.sh`
- `docs/instance-runbook.md`
- `docs/gateway-3-handoff.md`
- `PROMPT_ACTION_LOG.md`

### Findings

- Gateway 1 is not a clean Verde-only reference because its Gateway process starts with `codex/gpt-5.5`, even though its working-group agents use Verde.
- Gateway 2 is the better Verde-only reference: default model `verde/js2/gpt-oss-120b`, no OAuth profiles, `groupChat.visibleReplies = message_tool`, no `tools.byProvider` Verde deny block, and heartbeat active at 30 minutes.
- Gateway 3 had extra generated Verde tool restrictions and `automatic` visible replies.

### Changes Made

- Changed the container entrypoint default visible-replies mode to `message_tool`.
- Made the generated Verde minimal tool-deny profile opt-in through `OPENCLAW_VERDE_MINIMAL_TOOLS=1` instead of default.
- Updated `.env.example` to set `OPENCLAW_VISIBLE_REPLIES_MODE=message_tool` and `OPENCLAW_VERDE_MINIMAL_TOOLS=0`.
- Applied the same profile to live gateway 3, restored the default 30-minute heartbeat, copied the corrected entrypoint into the live container, and restarted only the gateway container.

### Tests Run

- `docker exec scienceclaw-project-two-openclaw-local-run-a402e0d22742 openclaw health`
- `docker exec scienceclaw-project-two-openclaw-local-run-a402e0d22742 openclaw models status`
- `docker exec scienceclaw-project-three-openclaw-local-run-96075a70e8ae openclaw health`
- `docker exec scienceclaw-project-three-openclaw-local-run-96075a70e8ae openclaw agent --agent main --session-id gateway3-verde-message-tool-20260522 --model verde/js2/gpt-oss-120b --message "Reply with exactly: MESSAGE_TOOL_OK" --timeout 120 --json`
- `docker exec scienceclaw-project-three-openclaw-local-run-96075a70e8ae openclaw agent --agent main --session-id gateway3-verde-persistent-20260522 --model verde/js2/gpt-oss-120b --message "Reply with exactly: VERDE_PERSISTENT_OK" --timeout 120 --json`

### Result

- Gateway 3 health returned to OK after the final smoke test settled.
- Final payload was `VERDE_PERSISTENT_OK`.

## 2026-05-26 - GitHub Actions Secret Alias Support

### Prompt Summary

Make the GitHub Actions runtime launch work with the repository secrets the user added through the GitHub UI.

### Changes Made

- Updated `.github/workflows/scienceclaw-runtime.yml` so the manual runtime workflow accepts local `.env`-style aliases for Verde and Slack secrets:
  - `VERDE_LLM_API_KEY`
  - `VERDE_LLM_BASE_URL`
  - `VERDE_LLM_DEFAULT_MODEL`
  - `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`
  - `SLACK_APP_TOKEN`
  - `SLACK_DEFAULT_CHANNEL`
- Kept `SCIENCECLAW_...` names as the documented preferred convention.
- Documented that agent-visible repository push/pull still requires `SCIENCECLAW_GITHUB_TOKEN`.

## 2026-05-26 - GitHub Actions Runtime State Path Fix

### Prompt Summary

Fix the manual GitHub Actions runtime workflow failure where `scripts/start-instance.sh` tried to create `/private/tmp` on a Linux runner.

### Changes Made

- Updated `scripts/start-instance.sh` to choose the OpenClaw runtime-state parent directory by platform:
  - `/private/tmp` when available and writable, mainly macOS local runs
  - `$RUNNER_TEMP` on GitHub Actions runners
  - `/tmp` as the generic Linux fallback
- Updated runtime-state documentation in the security guide and instance runbook.

## 2026-05-26 - Template GitHub Launch Documentation

### Prompt Summary

Document the desired template/fork launch path where a renamed repository can launch ScienceClaw with credentials and let agents push/pull against that same repository.

### Changes Made

- Added `docs/use/template-github-launch.md`.
- Added the new guide to MkDocs navigation under Launch and Daily Use.
- Updated Quick Start, Security and Credentials, and GitHub Repository Manager docs to explain the launch-repository workflow.
- Updated `.github/workflows/scienceclaw-runtime.yml` to optionally authorize and clone the launch repository into `/workspace/repos/<repo>` before starting the container.

## 2026-05-22 - Gateway 3 Button Approval UX

### Prompt Summary

Fix the remaining `/approve` problem by making approval flows prefer native UI/CMS buttons instead of asking the user to type command codes.

### Files Changed

- `.env.example`
- `docker/entrypoint.sh`
- `docker/seed-workspace/AGENTS.md`
- `docker/seed-workspace/HUMAN_REVIEW.md`
- `workspace/AGENTS.md`
- `docs/gateway-3-handoff.md`
- `PROMPT_ACTION_LOG.md`

### Findings

- The browser device already has `operator.approvals` scope.
- `openclaw gateway call exec.approval.list --json --params '{}'` works and returns `[]` when nothing is pending.
- The previous effective exec policy was `security=full`, `ask=off`, so normal exec actions did not create native pending approval requests or UI approval buttons.
- Bare `/approve` only makes sense for a specific pending approval id and decision; agents should not ask the user to type it.

### Changes Made

- Applied `openclaw exec-policy preset cautious --json` to live gateway 3.
- Added `OPENCLAW_EXEC_POLICY_PRESET=cautious` to `.env.example`.
- Updated the gateway entrypoint to apply `OPENCLAW_EXEC_POLICY_PRESET` at startup unless set to `none`.
- Updated workspace instructions to tell agents to use the OpenClaw approval UI or ScienceClaw CMS/GitHub manager buttons.
- Copied the updated `AGENTS.md`, `HUMAN_REVIEW.md`, and entrypoint into the live gateway 3 container.

### Verification

- `openclaw exec-policy show` reports `security=allowlist`, `ask=on-miss`, and host `askFallback=deny`.
- Native approval queue RPC is reachable.
- `bash -n docker/entrypoint.sh docker/service-entrypoint.sh scripts/start-instance.sh scripts/install-control-ui-branding.sh` passed.
