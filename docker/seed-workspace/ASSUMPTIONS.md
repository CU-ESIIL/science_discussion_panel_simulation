| ID | Assumption | Owner | Evidence | Risk if wrong | Status | Last reviewed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A-001 | Candidate environmental datasets have sufficient spatial and temporal coverage for the research question. | Data Engineer / Infrastructure Scientist | To be verified during data inventory. | Analysis may overgeneralize or miss important heterogeneity. | Open | 2026-05-17 |
| A-002 | Dataset licenses permit the planned internal analysis and any proposed release artifacts. | Citation & Evidence Curator | To be verified from source licenses and terms. | Outputs may be legally or ethically unsuitable for sharing. | Open | 2026-05-17 |
| A-003 | Observed associations should not be interpreted as causal without explicit design support. | Quantitative Modeler | General methodological caution; project-specific evidence pending. | Narrative may overstate findings or imply unsupported interventions. | Active caution | 2026-05-17 |
| A-004 | Environmental variables may have measurement error, missingness, and scale mismatch. | Domain Scientist | To be assessed during exploratory analysis. | Model results and figures may appear more precise than the data support. | Open | 2026-05-17 |
| A-005 | Community, Tribal, Indigenous knowledge, public health, legal, and policy claims require human and domain-specific review before use. | Societal Impact Agent | Required by workspace governance in `HUMAN_REVIEW.md`. | Harmful, inappropriate, or unsupported public-facing claims. | Active caution | 2026-05-17 |
