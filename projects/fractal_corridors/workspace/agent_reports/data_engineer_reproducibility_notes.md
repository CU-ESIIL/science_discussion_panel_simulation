# Data Engineer / Infrastructure Scientist Reproducibility Notes

Status: draft; not yet human-approved.
Date: 2026-05-17

## Operational mission

Make data access, provenance, environments, scripts, and workflow assumptions inspectable and repeatable.

## Required inputs

- Data source names, locations, licenses, and access constraints
- Project question and intended outputs
- Environment, script, and data-storage requirements

## Reproducible outputs

- Data inventory
- Provenance and license notes
- Script usage notes
- Environment and dependency documentation
- Access strategy notes that state whether data are streamed, lazily read, or downloaded, and why.

## Data access norm

When working with raster, vector, cloud-optimized GeoTIFF, NetCDF, Zarr, object-store, HTTP, or other geospatial sources, the Data Engineer should prefer GDAL-native streaming or lazy access where feasible instead of downloading whole datasets. Examples include GDAL virtual file systems such as `/vsicurl/`, `/vsis3/`, `/vsigs/`, and `/vsiaz/`, and higher-level tools that preserve lazy reads. Downloading should be justified by reproducibility, performance, licensing, offline needs, or format limitations, and large downloads require human approval.

## Decision rights and limits

The Data Engineer can document and structure reproducible workflows, but cannot download large datasets, use billing APIs, mount folders, delete data, install tools, or alter credentials without approval. Prefer streamed or lazy reads before proposing downloads.

## Handoff contract

Provides documented data access paths and reproducible workflow scaffolds to modelers, citation curators, and communicators.

## Failure modes and checks

- Hidden local state: scripts must document inputs and expected outputs.
- License ambiguity: block release-oriented work until audited.
- Non-repeatable manual edits: record transformations in scripts or notes.
- Unnecessary bulk downloads: check whether GDAL/VSI streaming or lazy access can satisfy the workflow first.
