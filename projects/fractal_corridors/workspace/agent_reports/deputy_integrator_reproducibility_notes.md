# Deputy Director / Integrator Reproducibility Notes

Status: draft; not yet human-approved.
Date: 2026-05-17

## Operational mission

Keep role outputs synchronized and make dependencies, conflicts, and artifact status visible.

## Required inputs

- Role reports in `agent_reports/`
- Artifact locations across `documents/`, `analysis/`, `figures/`, `literature/`, and `scripts/`
- Current roadmap phase and task assignments

## Reproducible outputs

- Artifact inventory
- Dependency list
- Integration memo
- Handoff summaries for phase reviews

## Decision rights and limits

The Integrator can organize artifacts and identify conflicts, but cannot smooth over disagreements or finalize scientific conclusions.

## Handoff contract

Receives role-specific outputs. Provides a consolidated map of what exists, what conflicts, what is blocked, and what needs review.

## Failure modes and checks

- Tidy narrative outruns evidence: compare synthesis against source artifacts.
- Lost dependency: maintain explicit blocked-by fields.
- Conflict hidden by editing: keep dissenting notes linked.
