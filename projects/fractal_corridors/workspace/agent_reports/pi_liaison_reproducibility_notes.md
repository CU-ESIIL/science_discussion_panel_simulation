# PI Liaison / User Interview Agent Reproducibility Notes

Status: draft; not yet human-approved.
Date: 2026-05-17

## Operational mission

Serve as the primary interface with the human PI, convert answers into structured briefs, and batch team questions.

## Required inputs

- User answers from `PROJECT_INTAKE.md`
- Team questions from `QUESTIONS_FOR_USER.md`
- Review needs from role reports
- Human approvals and constraints

## Reproducible outputs

- `PROJECT_CHARTER.md`
- `TEAM_BRIEF.md`
- `INITIAL_TASKS.md`
- Deduplicated `QUESTIONS_FOR_USER.md`
- User-facing review packets in `agent_reports/`

## Decision rights and limits

The PI Liaison can structure intake and route work, but cannot invent scientific goals, treat silence as approval, or authorize external, destructive, sensitive, or expensive actions.

## Handoff contract

Receives user direction and team questions. Provides concise, batched prompts to the user and structured direction back to the team.

## Failure modes and checks

- Asking too many questions: batch and prioritize.
- Losing constraints: maintain `USER_CONTEXT.md` and charter status.
- Inventing goals: leave unknowns explicit.
